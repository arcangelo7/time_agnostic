# time-agnostic-builder

Time-Agnostic Builder is a Python &ge;3.7 software to build an RDF dataset starting from the ISSN of a journal present on Crossref. The output dataset is compliant with the [OCDM v2.0.1](https://figshare.com/articles/Metadata_for_the_OpenCitations_Corpus/3443876) specification. It is agnostic about time because changes and provenance are tracked adopting the same data model: any past version can be read and retrieved along with its metadata.

## Getting started
Before starting, you need to make sure you have Python3.x installed on your computer, in addition, in order to correctly execute the Python-based scripts indicated in the methodology, you must install the required libraries defined in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/arcangelo7/time_agnostic/blob/main/requirements.txt). Please follow the official Python guidelines at https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/ to check and eventually install Python and the required libraries locally on your machine.

The [tutorial.py](https://github.com/arcangelo7/time_agnostic/blob/main/tutorial.py) file in the repository's root directory contains usage examples of all the available methods. 

### Get data

Before building the dataset, you need to download the data from Crossref. To do this, use the `DatasetBuilder.get_journal_data_from_crossref` method, indicating the journalâ€™s ISSN, an email, the path to save the data, and if you want to save logs on any running or network errors. For more information on why to indicate the email, see the [Crossref REST API etiquette](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/#etiquette). 
```python
JOURNAL_ISSN = "0138-9130"
EMAIL = "arcangelo.massari@studio.unibo.it"
DATA_PATH = "./data/scientometrics.json"

DatasetBuilder.get_journal_data_from_crossref(journal_issn=JOURNAL_ISSN, your_email=EMAIL, path=DATA_PATH, logs=True)
```

### Build the dataset
To build the dataset, instance the `DatasetBuilder` class, indicating the base URI, your ORCID in the `resp_agent` field, and the path to save the generated entities counters (`info_dir`). For more information about what an ORCID is and how to create one, consult [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/).

Then, run `generate_graph`, specifying where the data obtained in the [previous step](#get-data) were saved.

To produce the provenance related to the dataset creation, use the `Support.generate_provenance` method, indicating the newly generated dataset (`graphset`), the base URI and the path to save the snapshot counters (`info_dir`).

```python
BASE_URI = "https://github.com/opencitations/time-agnostic-library/"
RESP_AGENT = "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8420-0696"
INFO_DIR_GRAPH = "./info_dir/graph/"
INFO_DIR_PROV = "./info_dir/prov/"
DATA_PATH = "./data/scientometrics.json"

dataset_builder = DatasetBuilder(base_uri=BASE_URI, resp_agent=RESP_AGENT, info_dir=INFO_DIR_GRAPH)
scientometrics = dataset_builder.generate_graph(journal_data_path=DATA_PATH)
scientometrics_prov = Support.generate_provenance(graphset=scientometrics, base_iri=BASE_URI, info_dir=INFO_DIR_PROV)
```
